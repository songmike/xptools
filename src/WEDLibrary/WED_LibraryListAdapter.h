		/* What is a prefix and how do I use it? A guide about how to use
		* mCache and mOpen with all their related methods with the new prefix system.
		*
		* Keywords: mOpen, mCache, Library Pane, Library List Adapter, Library Manager, 
		* Catagories, Prefixes, Virtual Paths, Real Paths
		*
		* Intro: What is a prefix?
		*	To try and split up the Library Pane into Local Files and Library Files for
		* useability and readability sake the program added on a prefix of whatever is in
		* mLocalStr or mLibraryStr (most likely "Local/" or "Library/" repectively.) For example
		* LocalObjects/things/stuff.obj becomes Loc/LocalObjects/things/stuff.obj
		* 
		* Where is this used?
		*	Everywhere until it is not allowed to be used. Because the prefixes are added in
		* RebuildCache and RebuildCacheRecusive (the cores of this class) they are used in
		* all other methods until data is needed from the library manager or other special clauses.
		* It is especially used in drawing.
		*
		* How do I transform the strings and get/set their data? Also when should I do that?
		*	 
		*	Good news is that it is mostly done for you! In Rebuild Cache it produces all the strings
		* with the prefix attached and calculates the position of what indexs in the Vector mCache
		* are where mLocalStr and mLibraryStr are. Instead of saying string path= mCache[index] it is
		* best to use the method GetNthCacheIndex. GetNth, for short, handles the adding and removing
		* of the prefix data for you. Just pass in the index and whether or not you want the prefix
		* and it will return a string for you*
		*
		*	It is extremely recommended that you DO NOT change mCache itself or handle getting that data yourself
		* because the system is very tightly wound up with proper placement of /'s and careful adding and removing
		* of charecters. Only do this if you are very comfortable with how this class wide system works and
		* you undo your change at the end of your process
		*
		* *If you pass in mLocalStr and mLibraryStr it will give you back their vaule minus the '/'. For example
		* Local/ becomes Local. This is mainly used for drawing.
		*
		*
		* A table of how strings appear and move through the program
		* Assume mLocalStr and mLibraryStr are equal to "Local/" and "Library/"
		* 
		*String| Local/ or Library/    | Local or Library   | Buildings/FoodStands/RustBurger.obj | Local/Buildings/FoodStands/RustBurger.obj|
		* Use  | mOpen,mCache,mSel     | Drawing            | Library Manager, reasource lookup   | Drawing, mOpen, mCache, mSel             |
		* Get  | mCatLocInd, mCatLibInd| GetNth(index, true)| GetNth(index, true)                 | GetNth(index, false)                     |
		* Set  | RebuildCache()        | Constructor        | LibraryManager(from your HDD)       | Manually change string (Danger)          |
		*
		* Common trouble shooting tip: If something is not working it means you have added/not added the prefix propperly, 
		* forgot it, or forgot to reset it.
